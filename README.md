# MySQL

1. **ER and EER Modeling**:
   
   My MySQL journey began with crafting intricate Entity-Relationship (ER) and Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) models.
   These visual representations allowed me to design and conceptualize the complex relationships within databases, providing a solid foundation for effective data management.

2. **Table Management**:
  
   I honed my skills in table management, mastering the art of creating, updating, and dropping tables.
   This hands-on experience ensured my databases remained agile, ready to adapt to changing business needs and evolving data structures.

3. **Query Mastery**:

   Armed with SQL, I embarked on crafting a diverse array of queries. From simple, targeted data extraction to complex operations involving JOINs and concatenations,
   I harnessed the power of queries to retrieve and manipulate data with precision and efficiency.

4. **Relational Algebra**:

   My journey took a deeper dive into the theoretical underpinnings of databases with relational algebra.
   This exploration enhanced my understanding of core database concepts, strengthening my ability to design and optimize database systems for real-world applications.


These MySQL projects underscore my proficiency in database management, data retrieval, and theoretical foundations. 
They equip me with invaluable skills for practical database development and administration, preparing me to tackle complex data challenges with confidence.
